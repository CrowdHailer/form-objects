Ruby Form Objects
=================

Working on Recent projects to explore Domain Driven Design *(DDD)* I have discovered Veto and Virtus ruby gems. This is an exploration of using them.

### Principles
Particularly in controller actions I have primarily used errors as a controll flow mechanism. I will be trying to avoid that here.

### Challenges
The aim is to create some object Mixins that sensibly represent a time, location and money from form values. 
These three are from a recent customer project. from database
